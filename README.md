yabai-chooser
=============

Coming from WMII I am used to wmiichooser.
Which allows to be passed a list of wordv (tags=spaces).
Then select one or enter a new one.

This yabai-chooser models it.

usage
=====
yabai-choser "TITLE" space1 sapce2 space3 space3

Then you can either choose label of existing or enter a new one.
command-{1,2,3} shortcuts are available to choose the first 10 items
Filtering and Tab completion works on names.

This is my first Swift project.

yabai
=====
When used with yabai of course you want to use managed=off to cause floating/
on top mode

I checked quit a lot even fltk-rs but that consumed even 10 MB more.
So Swift seems to be good enough for this job
